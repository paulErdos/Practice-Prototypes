## Dev Notes

### ================================================================================
### Setup + Dev Notes
### ================================================================================

Setup New NextUI Project*
* nextui init my-nextui-app
* Select pages


Left off:
* experiment 1 > app-name > app > page.tsx
  - Added a button


Where I'm going:
* Have the button link to another page
* See how easy it is to put some stuff together.


Thoughts:
* Probably best for my own personal development to do this in vanilla React
* Probably best for getting the project done to at least see if this can save time
  and look better. The goal is to get users.


To-Do:
* Create a directory for design notes.
* Look into Tailwind libraries. A lot of what I'm doing with NextUI has a goal of
  looking cooler. I wanted a toolbox of stuff I can add in, not a separate
  framework. That said, nother framework and exposure to tsx probably great. One
  goal at present is diversification.
