The 5-Cell pentatope 4-simplex is a pyramid in four dimensions.

The goal is to visualize the five tetrahedra that comprise the polychoron
itself.

At hand is a pixelblaze and 5x 20-led neopixel strands.

The polychoron itself can be thought of as a fully connected graph on five
nodes. This implies ten edges: 12 LEDs per edge.

Steps:
1. (Done) Figure out the very basics of addressing one edge at a time.
